Conflicts with:
  aardvark_shell_utils (because both install `realpath` binaries)
  ganglia (because both install `gstat` binaries)
  gegl (because both install `gcut` binaries)
  idutils (because both install `gid` and `gid.1`)

==> Caveats
All commands have been installed with the prefix "g".
If you need to use these commands with their normal names, you
can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:
  PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:
  MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
